Implemented a machine learning model using Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to predict nationalities based on names. Achieved an accuracy of 72.3%. The project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction from names, and training/testing the model to classify nationalities, demonstrating effective use of probabilistic classifiers in name-based categorization tasks. A Flask-based UI allows users to input names and receive nationality predictions, showcasing a complete machine learning solution integrated with a user-friendly web interface.
